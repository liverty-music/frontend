## TailwindCSS Integration

This project includes TailwindCSS for utility-first CSS styling. TailwindCSS allows you to rapidly build custom user interfaces using low-level utility classes.

### Using TailwindCSS

TailwindCSS is automatically configured and ready to use. You can use any TailwindCSS utility classes in your HTML templates and components.

Example:
```html
<div class="max-w-md mx-auto bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md overflow-hidden">
  <div class="p-8">
    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Hello TailwindCSS!</h1>
    <p class="text-gray-600">Build amazing UIs with utility classes.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Customizing TailwindCSS

To customize your TailwindCSS configuration, create a `tailwind.config.js` file in your project root:

```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'brand-blue': '#1fb6ff',
        'brand-purple': '#7e5bef',
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
